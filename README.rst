This Asphalt framework component provides the ability to parse syndication feeds like RSS_ and
Atom_.

Each feed is polled periodically and subscribers are notified of any newly published
entries. There is also support for persisting the state of each feed in various kinds of databases.
Arbitrary HTML pages can also be scraped as feeds by means of a custom feed reader class.
